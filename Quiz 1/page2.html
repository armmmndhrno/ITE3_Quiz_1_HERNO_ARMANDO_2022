            FOR ME?
        </h1>
        <p>
            I like working on the back-end side, not because I'm not good in doing aesthetics, it's because I like to work around technical stuff.

            That's why I can say that I'm on the server side. I like solving technical and logical problems and puzzles. It makes me think outside of the box like I don't think on what is obvious. I sometimes overthink somethings, most likely when I'm coding.

            I mean there's nothing wrong for me being in the client side but I just don't know what will look good on something, I rather think how it will work rather how it will look in a project because that's what I'm good for, technical stuff. hehe.
