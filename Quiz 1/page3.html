               When I was a kid I always wanted to be a scientist one day because I'm always curious about almost everthing. I remember one time this extreme currriousity of mine nearly kill me because I just want to know how it feels to be stabbed in the chest because for me it must be painful right? But ofcourse my extreme curiousity about things kicks in a very dangerous way possible and ended up stabbing my self in the chest in a fence. To be honest I don't feel anything, maybe because of shock but I do remember the almost never ending flow of blood coming from my chest.

               Fastforward when I'm choosing a course in college. I chose IT because in my teenage years I took interest in technology and how it works and ended up taking ICT in my senior high and eventually decided to take IT as my college course.

               I enjoy the first years of my college experience. Why? Because of friends i made that day. I enjoy taking up to a challenge because of my friends that I made back then we always making memories everytime we are in the campus. I'd say that it was the best experience in my first years of college. Sadly most of them stop in studying because of covid.

               I'm planning to improve my current experience in coding. My roadmap will be like making a small or simple games solving logical problems in programming because I know this simple task will help me long term. As I take a step-by-step progress little by little I will learn much more complicated processes and I hope by the next 5-10 years I'm more experienced in advanced side of programming.
